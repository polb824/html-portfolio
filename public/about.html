<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Paul Barredo (*Bow*)</p>

<p>I thought programmming is boring, and ewwie. So I proceed to study Adobe Photoshop first, 
  and guess what, I ENJOYED IT! So yeah I tried studying web development and I WAS WRONG! ╭( ๐_๐)╮
  I really enjoyed it even tho, this website looks shitty but yeah. More improvements to come. <img src="https://parspng.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/imojipng.parspng.com-7.png"
